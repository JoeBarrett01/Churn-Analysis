# Churn-Analysis

The following provides an analysis of churn - objectively identifying key features that may impact OCI Churn.

1.	Are there unstudied or uncalculated characteristics that might impact the probability of a startup churning?
2.	Do we need to adjust our definition of churn (e.g., no usage for 15 days or adding an additional condition)?

TO DO:
Run feature correlation using:
(1) Pearson
(2) Backward Selection

Lastly:
Create predictive analysis. Chosen method (bagging) Random Forests. One forest for each feeature correlation created above.
